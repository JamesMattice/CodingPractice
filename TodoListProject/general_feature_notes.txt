Stream of consciousness notes about the project cause I can't figure out a way to format it all yet.

UX -> Feature-Set -> Value Proposition -> Unserved Needs/Problem Statement -> Target Customer


UX -  
	Basic Display window
	Menu
	Navigation
	Search features (both for general use of the app and for things within the data)
	Multiple Views for amounts of detailed information provided (i.e. popups that would show all the data of a given object)
	Context specific views and navigation (i.e. a calendar(with day/week/month views))
	*An Avatar? animated?
	


Feature-Set:
	User Feedback (bugs, survey/suggestions)\
	User Rating/review (might be handled by the service that hosts the app)
	Data Security (user verification, password protection, etc)
	Data Storage (could be local to the device, but would probably want to at least have a cloud backup)
	**make this another section of the notes:::::Program Execution (would need to be able to run in the background [with low resource usage] and a notification system
	Provide data analytics for user tasks  (the average time taken per task, estimation accuracy)
	Check-in feature/accountability
	
	
Value-Proposition
	A multi-purpose digital assistant that would be able to be extended to provide extra features as development progressed.
	Providing pretty much just the feature set's list of things.
	Basic Set - task scheduling, interface with calendar programs
	Extra features (all optional) - All the voice crap, multi-language support.
	

	
Why would people want to use this?  What makes it different from other existing products?
I want a Jarvis.
Connecting smaller apps to a google calendar(or other calendar) system to provide a one-stop shop style with the added benefit of building reminders into things like your workout plans, shopping trips, etc.
