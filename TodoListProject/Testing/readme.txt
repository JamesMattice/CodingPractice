This directory will contain all of the test code associated with this project.
If an automated test suite is incorporated into the project, it should also be included and run from this folder.

Questions:
Should the folder structure be identical to that of the base project?  or is there a more logical organization?
Do we want to track code coverage with a testing structure?
Unit testing and/or end to end and/or requirement tests?
