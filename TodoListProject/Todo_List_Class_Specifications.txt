Some combination of read me and design document.

Simple list of tasks to do.
	Data:
		Name
		date for next completion
		frequency to be completed
		Status (or just remove it from the list when completed)
		
	Methods:
		Data manipulation
		Constructors





Full Functionality:
	Data:
		Name
		frequency to be completed
		priority
		number of completions
		max number of completions
		time since last completion
		Category
		date for next completion
		time spent on task
		Status of task
		Level of complexity/time
		Notes about the task
		Associated tasks (prereqs, similar, mutually exclusive)
	
	Methods:
		Get Daily list
		Notifications for time remaining to complete
		Track time spent
		(Data manipulation methods (get, set, add, remove, copy (elements or full lists), etc))
		Reminders (available tasks, new tasks, priority tasks)
		List comparisons
		Logic for suggesting a task
		Logic for improving tasks (i.e. breaking down one that is taking too much time into sub-tasks, changing the assigned difficulty)
		Logic for Notes field
		Logic for calendar management / time management
		Constructors
		I/O (input/output)
			formatting
			types
		UI (user interface)
		Progression 
		Search Functions
